				<p>Riffing on the cat example. One of my favorite places in Chicago is the Art Institute. It's a world-class collection spanning 					numerous time periods, artists, and genres. I just saw the Caillebotte exhibit. Past favorites include Georgia O'Keeffe's New 					York and Gaugin Artist as Alchemist. Meeting friends and walking in the area makes for a lovely day.<p>
				<h2>Original Text for This Website</h2>
				<p>I'm sure I'll be frustrated with at least one of the assignments this semester, but coding is fun! Learning new development 						environments and languages is interesting. I think the mention of configuration management in the demos is important. I don't 					know how rigorous CM is in a library environment, but I would hope that it doesn't depend on the person or people staffing IT. 					Looking forward to building some websites!<p>
				<h3>Additional Text of a Literary Sort</h3>
				<p>Adding some verbiage for exercise06 and on, first a poem by T.S. Eliot about cats and their names, because why not?! Here's a <a href="https://poets.org/poem/naming-cats" target="_blank">link</a> to the poetry page & copyright info, or you can find it on the bottom of this page. "The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter, It isn’t just one of your holiday games;
You may think at first I’m as mad as a hatter
When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.
First of all, there’s the name that the family use daily,
Such as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo, or James,
Such as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey— All of them sensible everyday names.
There are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter,
Some for the gentlemen, some for the dames:
Such as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter—
But all of them sensible everyday names,
But I tell you, a cat needs a name that’s particular,
A name that’s peculiar, and more dignified,
Else how can he keep up his tail perpendicular,
Or spread out his whiskers, or cherish his pride?
Of names of this kind, I can give you a quorum,
Such as Munkustrap, Quaxo, or Coricopat,
Such as Bombalurina, or else Jellylorum—
Names that never belong to more than one cat.
But above and beyond there’s still one name left over,
And that is the name that you never will guess;
The name that no human research can discover—
But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess.
When you notice a cat in profound meditation,
The reason, I tell you, is always the same:
His mind is engaged in a rapt contemplation
Of the thought, of the thought, of the thought of his name:
His ineffable effable
Effanineffable
Deep and inscrutable singular name"</p>
