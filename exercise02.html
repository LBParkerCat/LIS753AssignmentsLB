<p>Riffing on the cat example. One of my favorite places in Chicago is the Art Institute. It's a world-class collection spanning numerous time periods, artists, and genres. I just saw the Caillebotte exhibit. Past favorites include Georgia O'Keeffe's New York and Gaugin Artist as Alchemist. Meeting friends and walking in the area makes for a lovely day.<p>
<p>I'm sure I'll be frustrated with at least one of the assignments this semester, but coding is fun! Learning new development environments and languages is interesting. I think the mention of configuration management in the demos is important. I don't know how rigorous CM is in a library environment, but I would hope that it doesn't depend on the person or people staffing IT. Looking forward to building some websites!<p>
